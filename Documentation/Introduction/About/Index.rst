What does it do?
----------------

This extension provides the basic configuration for typed categories.
It is not recommended to use this extension alone, as it only provides a basic
framework. In order to perform typification, an addition in a separate extension
is required.
Examples can be found in the following FGTCLB extensions:

* `Academic Studies`_
* `Academic Research Database`_

.. _Academic Studies: https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/academic_studies
.. _Academic Research Database: https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/academic_researchdatabase
