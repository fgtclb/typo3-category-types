This and all other `academic-*` extensions are developed within a single mono-repository [1] as a central
place to communicate and keep the development in sync.

For issues, contact and overview of the development, or if you want to contribute please head over to the
[academic-extensions mono-repository](https://github.com/fgtclb/academic-extensions).
