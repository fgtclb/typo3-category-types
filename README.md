# TYPO3 extension `category_types`

This extension provides the basic configuration for typed categories.
It is not recommended to use this extension alone, as it only provides a basic
framework. In order to perform typification, an addition in a separate extension
is required.

## Installation

Install with your flavour:

* [TER](https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/category_types/)
* Extension Manager
* composer

We prefer composer installation:
```bash
composer req fgtclb/category-types
```
